The Data Encryption Standard (DES) is a symmetric encryption algorithm first introduced by IBM in 1975 as a submission
to the National Bureau of Standards (NBS). The NBS needed a way to encrypt unclassified electronic documents and by
publishing it as an NSA-approved standard opened it up to wider adoption and increased scruteny. The design 
and short falls of DES influenced the field of cryptography and many of the encryption algorithms we use today.


## How does DES work?




## What is Tripple DES?

As it turns out DES was vulnerable to key space attacks if you had sufficiently large compute power. While this may not have been practicle for the average consumer it was plausable that a state or foreign entity with reason to crack DES could do so.



## Validating Tripple DES

Validating that an algorithm works is a very import aspect of why you would want to use it in the first place.
