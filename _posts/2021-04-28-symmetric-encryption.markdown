Symmetric encryption is a type of encryption where the same key is used to encrypt and decrypt plain text data.
You can think of symmetric encyption like locking the front door of your house before going out. You would need
to have that same key to get back into the house. The key could also be given to someone else or even copied 
but that same key is needed to unlock the door.


# Types of symmetric encryption algorithms


## Block cyphers

Block cyphers encrypt plain text data in fixed sized chunks called blocks. The block size is usually the same as the key size 
used to encrypt the data. 


## Stream cyphers
